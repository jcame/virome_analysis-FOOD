# vapline_v2.0 (Virome Analysis Pipeline 2.0)

## Introduction

This is a respository that contains a general workflow for virome analyses at UCPH-FOOD.
To be able to implementing this workflow you will need access to:

- Linux system (e.g. Ubuntu) (w/ administrator rights)
- :: Anaconda version 3
- R-base version 4.1.1 or higher | make sure the "tidyverse" package is installed

To implement the workflow, you will have to install the following dependencies and create a "bin" directory:
```
conda install -c bioconda trimmomatic
conda install -c bioconda seqkit 
conda install -c bioconda bbmap 
conda install -c bioconda fastq-pair 
conda install -c bioconda spades  
conda install -c bioconda seqtk
conda install -c bioconda virsorter 
  virsorter setup -d db -j 22 # this will install the required databases, -j 22 = 22 cores | modify accordingly
conda install -c bioconda bowtie 
conda install -c bioconda samtools

usearch  #Download the free version of usearch (e.g. version 11) | https://www.drive5.com/usearch/download.html | make usearch is executable by running the following line:
chmod 775 usearch*
mv usearch* bin/
```

In addition, you should download the following customized databases:

- Modified DB of Viral Orthologous Groups (VOGs | https://vogdb.org/) + proteins from Anelloviruses (Circoviridae) derived from our recent pre-print Shah et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.02.450849) 
```

LINk2
```

- A DB of CRISPRs spacers and tRNAs predicted from species-level genome bins (SGBs) described in Pasolli et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.01.001) & metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) described in Castro-Mej√≠a et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.01.458531) 
```

LINk2
```

- Nextera adaptors/transposases & PhiX Illumina control sequences
```

LINk2
```


The workflow contains 6 wrappers dealing with the following steps:

1) Fastq QC + reads labeling + dereplicating + identifying sequence pairs + de-novo assembly

2) QC of assembled contigs + vOTUs labeling (ONLY Linux systems - just because 'Virsorter2' is not supported in VMs or MAC)

3) Taxonomy annotation of vOTUs

4) Bacterial host-prediction of vOTUs

5) vOTUs abundance stats

6) Integrated results
